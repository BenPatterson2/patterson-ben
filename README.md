This is a mess and I'm working on cleaning up the code. It's a combination of the code for a project for a web development 
class and the code for my dimensional weight calculator. 

I'm currently cleaning up the code for the blog for another project. I'm hoping to rewrite most of the dim weight calculator after studying javascript.

Runs on google app engine, uses jinja.
